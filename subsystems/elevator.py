"""
The elevator raises and lowers the grabber mechanisms
it uses a forklift style lift with three bars that slide against each other
it is powered with a 775 motor, a speed controller, an encoder to read the height,
and a limit switch at the bottom to stop it from over moving.

The motor pulls a string to lift the system. use the encoder to monitor the distance
(or discuss another potentiometer system like last year)
